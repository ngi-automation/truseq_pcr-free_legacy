## Description ##
This document describes how to set up the automated TruSeq PCR-free protocol for the Agilent NGS Workstation option B created at NGI Stockholm. This version of the PCR-free protocol is not in use anymore at NGI but has since long been replaced by a version that utilise our custom extended Bravo configuration. Therefore it does not contain any of the optimisations and improvements made since.

## Installation ##
### Download files ###

##### Using Git #####
Clone into `https://github.com/ngi-automation/truseq_pcr-free_legacy.git` from the `Protocol Files` directory:

```bash
cd "C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files"
git clone https://github.com/ngi-automation/truseq_pcr-free_legacy.git
```

Alternatively, download the compressed folder from:
[`https://github.com/ngi-automation/truseq_pcr-free_legacy/archive/master.zip`][zip]
and extract to `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files`. Rename the resulting `truseq_pcr-free_legacy-master` folder to `truseq_pcr-free_legacy`. The path to the folder containing the extracted files should then be `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files\truseq_pcr-free_legacy`.

### Configure ###
#### Labware and and liquid class definitions ####
Use the import feature in VWorks from `File â€º Import`in the toolbar and select the `all_labware_liquids.vzp` file included. See the [VWorks Knowledge Base][import] for more information.

#### Device files ####

Device files and profiles are system specific and will not be provided. The "standard" Bravo configuration is used in the TruSeq PCR-free protocols:

##### Standard configuration #####
Position | Type | Part#
-------: | ---- | -----
1&ndash;3, 8  | Deck Platepad | `G5498b#004`
4, 6     | Peltier Thermal Station (Inheco) | `G5498b#021`
5        | Orbital Shaking Station | `G5498b#033`
7        | Magnetic Bead Accessory | `G5498b#008`
9        | Thermal Station (ThermoCube) | `G5498b#036`/`7`/`8`

For reference see Agilent's [accessories catalog][catalog] for the Bravo.

Each `.pro` file must have the correct device file set:

See the [VWorks Knowledge Base][device-file] for more information on how to select the device file.

## Protocol ##

An abridged version of the old NGI Stockholm/SciLifeLab SOP can be accessed [here][sop] and should contain the neccessary instructions to set up and run the robot protocol.
